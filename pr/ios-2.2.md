Longplay 2.1 adds interactive widgets for iOS 17 with [fabulous animations](https://vimeo.com/863056534) that also work very well in StandBy, let's you appreciate your album wall in the app without any UI chrome, and adds new Shortcuts actions.

Updated **Album Wall** widget:

- Shows a grid of albums, tapping one starts playing it, tapping it again will pause playback.
- Playback status is indicated by the album resizing, just as in the app. Like an adorable mini Longplay.
- This widget is now available in sizes small (9 albums), medium (18 albums), and large (36 albums).

All new **Now Playing** widget:

- Show the currently playing album, or suggests a random one, if nothing is playing; with play/pause button.
- Shuffle button to switch to a random album (disabled while album is playing; pause playback first)
- Shows a spider chart of the album's metrics (recency, memory, length, negligence, stars, addiction) â€“ tap it or the album artwork to toggle between the two.
- Available in small and medium.

Other improvements in this update:

- The "My Library" dropdown will fade away as you scroll through your albums, giving you a pristine chrome-free look of just your albums (can be disabled in the settings).
- New Shortcuts actions.

_This update will be available when iOS 17 launches._
