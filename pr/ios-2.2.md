title: "[Press Release] Longplay 2.2: Apple Vision Pro – and get creative with Shortcuts"
date: 2024-01-20
---

With version 2.2, Longplay brings its album focus to Apple Vision Pro: the same features as on iOS and adding a rich **immersive experience** of your albums on a massive curved wall — which could be straight out of the Matrix.

On iOS, the 2.2 update greatly improves and extends the **Shortcuts** support with over two dozen new actions, opening up a variety of customisation and advanced use cases.

Standout features for **visionOS**:
- View and pick albums from an **immersive space** where the app breaks beyond the window and the albums wrap around you. [See video](https://vimeo.com/904694210).
- The "regular" app window has been **optimised for visionOS**, with ornaments and toggling between the album view and now playing mode in the same window.

Some examples of what's possible with **Shortcuts**:
- Create a pretty image of your recently listened albums, or share it as a weekly note, or add it to your diary.
- Smart ad-hoc collections: Search albums by artist, genre, year, metrics; then view them in the app, and play or add them to a collection.
- Tap your iPhone's Action Button to resume your last Longplay session if nothing is playing yet, or rate the current track if something is playing.

Details and other improvements:
- **Universal purchase** between iOS and visionOS
- Search/filter albums
- Sort albums by release year
- An album inspector to view tracks, playback stats, and edit some details

*This update will be available when Apple Vision Pro ships on 2nd February 2024.*
