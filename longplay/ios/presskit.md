### About the App

Longplay is an app for music lovers with a sizable Apple Music or iTunes library who like to listen to entire albums. It is a music player that focuses on just the albums from which you have (nearly) added all the songs - making it quick to get to the music that means the most to you. This is in contrast to the rather cluttered "Albums" view in Apple's Music app that includes all the albums where you even just have a handful of songs.

The app let's you explore your albums or playlists by various sort options — a unique one is _Negligence_ which combines how highly you've ranked an album, and when you last listened to it.

You can organise your albums into collections, which stay in sync across your devices using iCloud. Say, for your favourites albums, live albums, kids' albums, albums you like to listening to while working, or albums for a road trip.

Infinite Album Shuffle let's you listen to your albums non-stop.

It supports CarPlay, AirPlay, iCloud sync, Siri and Shortcuts.

### About the 2.0 Update

This version is a big update:

The stand-out new features are the Infinite Album Shuffle, an in-app Now Playing screen, the ability to create collections and manage the queue of albums.

It also adds iCloud sync of your collections and playback stats. It let's you see the track list of an album and rate individual tracks in-app. It adds new settings to auto-skip tracks below a certain rating or that are marked as explicit. It adds a CarPlay app to access your albums and collections right from the comfort of your driver's seat — perfect for road trips. It also adds Siri support and adds more Shortcuts. Lastly, you can now connect a Last.fm or Listenbrainz account to keep track of your listens.

The full list of additions is in the [changelog]({% link longplay/ios/changelog.md %}).

A lot of love and polish went into this update, iterating on the very helpful feedback from the beta testers, as well as from Apple designers in a WWDC Design Lab.

The update is free for existing users. The release date is 31 August 2023. The price of the app will go up to 6 USD that date (from 3.99).

### About the Developer

As my main occupation, I'm the CTO of [SkedGo Pty Ltd](https://skedgo.com), a small-to-medium sized company building a multi-modal transport platform and front-end apps, including [TripGo](https://skedgo.com/tripgo).

Longplay is my first indie app. I like listening to entire music albums. The app therefore came out of my personal need for wanting quick access to just the complete albums in my music library - without all those albums where I've just added a single song or two. I built an initial version for myself in 2015, decided in early 2020 to ship it. Version 1.0 was shipped in August 2020. Version 2.0 ships in August 2023.
