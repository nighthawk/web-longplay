Longplay collects no personal data about you or what you play through it. The app is distributed through Apple's iOS App Stores, where you are subject to the default, anonymous [App Analytics](https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-analytics) and crash reporting collection provided by Apple. You can opt-in to or opt-out of this when prompted via iOS.

Longplay uses an third-party analytics service called [TelemetryDeck](https://telemetrydeck.com) to collect anonymised usage data, such as number of albums and playlists in your library, which sort/size settings, or widgets are used. TelemetryDeck does not collect any personally identifiable information. Please also refer to [TelemetryDeckâ€™s privacy policy](https://telemetrydeck.com/privacy).

If you enable the optional iCloud sync feature, your album collections, ratings and playback statistic will be stored in your iCloud account. This data is not accessible to the developer, and is only used to sync your data between your devices.

If you enable the optional Last.fm scrobbling feature, your scrobbles will be sent to Last.fm. This data is not accessible to the developer, and is only used to sync your scrobbles with Last.fm.

Similarly, if you enable the optional ListenBrainz tracking feature, your listens will be sent to ListenBrainz. This data is not accessible to the developer, and is only used to sync your listens with ListenBrainz.

This website implements simple, privacy-aware analytics via [GoatCounter](https://www.goatcounter.com), which is 100% open source. No personal information is collected. You can view GoatCounter's [privacy policy here](https://www.goatcounter.com/privacy).
