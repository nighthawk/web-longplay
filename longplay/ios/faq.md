### Which albums are displayed?

Longplay's purpose is to make listening to full albums easier, so it displays those albums for which you have (nearly) every song. This is determined by the relative percentage, absolute number of songs you have for of that album, and total duration of the songs you have.

### How do the sort options work?

- _Orderliness_: by artist, then by album
- _Addiction_: by amount of time spent listening
- _Brightness_: by the primary colour of the album artwork
- _Negligence_: by the time it's been since you've last listened to the album, weighted by the rating
- _Recency_: by date added
- _Stars_: by the rating you've provided for each song
- _Random_: shuffles all albums, re-shuffled every time you tap it

### Why are my albums greyed out?

When you're not connected to WiFi, albums in your library that you haven't downloaded to your device are faded. If you have a cellular connection and you allowed the Music app to download music over cellular, you will still be able to download and listen to that album though. However, mobile data charges might apply!

*Note*: There's an advanced settings in the Settings.app to adjust this setting. You can opt to keep the default behaviour of greying out while you're not on WiFi, to always grey out albums you haven't downloaded, or to never grey them out.

### Can I hide albums that I don't have downloaded?

Yes, when you have albums that are greyed out, swipe to get to the side setting and then select "Show" > "Downloaded only".

### It's showing all my kids' albums / meditation / white noise albums and playlists! Can I hide those?

Sure, you can. Long tap on an item you want to hide then select "Hide". If you later want to show it again, swipe to the side albums list to the side, select "Show" > "Hidden things" and it'll re-appear. You can then make it visible again, by long tapping it and selecting "Unhide".

### How do I add missing album artwort?

You can add album artwork via iTunes / the Music app on your computer via two ways:

- Using Apple's catalogue by selecting "File" > "Library" > "Get Album Artwork".
- Manually, by finding the artwork online, and then in iTunes by right-clicking the album, selecting "Get Info", navigating to the "Artwork" tab and then pressing "Add Artwork".

### Some of my album artwork is not showing up!

This can happen if the Music app did not yet download your artwork. Open the Music app, go to Library and then Albums, the artwork might be missing at first but it's downloaded as soon as you scroll through the list. If you then switch back to Longplay they should also start appearing.

### How do I rate albums?

Longplay uses the ratings for songs as you set them in iTunes and the Music app.

### Can I queue up multiple albums?

No, Longplay plays your selected album or playlist to completion and playback then stops. You can then decide what to play next.

I'd like to add queueing of albums in the future and it's a commonly requested feature, but currently the queue management of music playback for third-party apps is rather limited in iOS.

### I am tapping albums but all I see is a spinning indicator and playback doesn't start

This happens if you removed the Music app from your device. Go to the App Store and make sure it's installed. Then playback should work from Longplay.

### Does Longplay support Spotify?

No, support for Spotify is not provided. Longplay is a passion project of mine, and I don't use Spotify myself currently.

(If there's a keen iOS developer out there, who'd like to work with me on adding these, feel free to [reach out to me](mailto:words@longplay.app).)

### Is there a beta?

Not at the moment. The currently released version on the App Store is the most up-to-date.

### What are those playlists in the screenshots?
